# TC18: Analysis of Formula 1 data using Amazon Redshift and Tableau
Hands-on lab on Tableau conference 2018 using Amazon Redshift and Tableau Desktop to analyze Formula 1 data.

In this lab we will use Amazon Redshift as the Data Warehouse solution for the analysis of Formuala 1 data using Tableau Desktop. We will perform-
1. Launch Redshift cluster in individual/ group account.
2. Create table in Redshift using SQL Workbench/ J and load data from s3.
3. Connect Tableau desktop to the Redshift cluster and analyze the tables' data using vizualization.

## Important !!!
At the end of the lab delete the Redshift cluster to avoid incurring AWS charges. You can delete the cluster by selecting the cluster you launched during the lab from the AWS Management Console and then navigate to CLuster > Delete cluster.
